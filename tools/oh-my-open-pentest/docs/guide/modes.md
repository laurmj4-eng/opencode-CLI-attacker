# Engagement Modes

Seven modes. Each tuned for a different engagement context.

---

## Switching Modes

```bash
# Slash command (in session)
/mode bug-bounty
/mode ctf
/mode red-team
/mode blue-team
/mode offensive
/mode grey-hat
/mode auto

# Auto-detect from target
fullscan https://target.example.com
```

Auto-detection maps target indicators (URL, IP, hostname, keywords) to the most appropriate mode. You can always override.

---

## Auto

**Use when:** You don't know the target type yet, or want the agent to decide.

The agent inspects the target and selects the best-fit mode from the others. Tool priority adapts after the initial recon phase based on what the target looks like.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | Moderate |
| Tool priority | Adaptive |
| Skill chain | Detected at runtime |
| Parallelism | 4x |
| Stealth | Off |
| Report format | Standard |

---

## CTF

**Use when:** Competing in Capture The Flag challenges. Speed over stealth.

Exploitation runs first. The agent identifies the challenge category (web, binary, crypto, forensics, misc) and loads the matching skill chain immediately.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | None |
| Tool priority | Exploit → Enum → Recon |
| Skill chain | `ctf-recon` → `ctf-exploit` / `ctf-crypto` / `ctf-forensics` |
| Parallelism | 8x |
| Stealth | Off |
| DoS protection | Off |
| Report format | Flag submission |

**Skill chains by challenge type:**

| Type | Skills |
| :--- | :--- |
| Web | `ctf-recon` → `ctf-exploit` |
| Binary (pwn) | `ctf-recon` → `ctf-exploit` (pwntools) |
| Crypto | `ctf-crypto` |
| Forensics | `ctf-forensics` |
| Misc | `ctf-recon` → auto-detect |

---

## Bug Bounty

**Use when:** Running on public bug bounty programs (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, YesWeHack). Scope-strict. Report quality matters.

Recon-first. Every target is validated against program scope before active testing. DoS and out-of-scope techniques are blocked automatically.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | **Strict** — auto-stop on violation |
| Tool priority | Recon → Enum → Exploit |
| Skill chain | `pentest-recon` → `pentest-enum` → `pentest-exploit` → `pentest-report` |
| Parallelism | 4x |
| Stealth | Off |
| DoS protection | **On** |
| Exfiltration guard | **On** |
| Report format | HackerOne (CVSS + PoC + impact + remediation) |

Scope is parsed from the prompt or a scope file:

```
Scope: *.example.com
Out of scope: *.staging.example.com
Rules: No DoS, no automated account creation
```

---

## Red Team

**Use when:** Authorized red team operations. Stealth, persistence, and lateral movement are in scope.

Slow and quiet. Passive OSINT before any active scanning. Post-exploitation after initial access.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | Moderate |
| Tool priority | Recon → Exploit → Enum |
| Skill chain | `red-recon` → `red-exploit` → `red-lateral` → `red-persistence` |
| Parallelism | **2x** (stealth-constrained) |
| Stealth | **On** |
| DoS protection | **On** |
| Exfiltration guard | **On** |
| Report format | Executive summary (attack path narrative) |

**Post-exploitation skills:**

| Skill | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `red-lateral` | SMB/WinRM pivoting, Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash via bloodhound + crackmapexec + impacket |
| `red-persistence` | Scheduled tasks, registry, WMI, SSH keys, cron |

---

## Blue Team

**Use when:** Defensive operations — detection, incident response, forensics, threat hunting.

Detection-first. No offensive techniques. Output is an IR report with IOCs and remediation steps.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | Moderate |
| Tool priority | Enum → Recon → Report |
| Skill chain | `blue-detect` → `blue-ir` / `blue-forensics` → `blue-report` |

## Offensive

**Use when:** Authorized internal red team or pentest with full exploitation scope. No stealth required, max coverage.

Exploit-first, maximum parallelism. All tools enabled.

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scope enforcement | Moderate |

| Report format | Technical (full exploit chains, raw output) |

---

## Grey Hat

**Use when:** Research and educational contexts. Balanced offensive/defensive coverage.

Stealth enabled by default. Scope enforcement moderate. Both offensive skills and blue team detection run in parallel.

| Property | Value |

## Forensic
