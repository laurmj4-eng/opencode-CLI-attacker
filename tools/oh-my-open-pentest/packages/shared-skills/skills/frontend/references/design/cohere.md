# Design System Inspired by Cohere

## .. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Cohere's interface is a polished enterprise command deck — confident, clean, and designed to make AI feel like serious infrastructure rather than a consumer toy. The experience lives on a bright white canvas where content is organized into generously rounded cards (22px radius) that create an organic, cloud-like containment language. This is a site that speaks to CTOs and enterprise architects: professional without being cold, sophisticated without being intimidating.

The design language bridges two worlds with a dual-typeface system: CohereText, a custom display serif with tight tracking, gives headlines the gravitas of a technology manifesto, while Unica77 Cohere Web handles all body and UI text with geometric Swiss precision. This serif/sans pairing creates a "confident authority meets engineering clarity" personality that perfectly reflects an enterprise AI platform.

Color is used with extreme restraint — the interface is almost entirely black-and-white with cool gray borders (`#d9d9dd`, `#e5e7eb`). Purple-violet appears only in photographic hero bands, gradient sections, and the interactive blue (`#.863dc`) that signals hover and focus states. This chromatic restraint means that when color DOES appear — in product screenshots, enterprise photography, and the deep purple section — it carries maximum visual weight.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Bright white canvas with cool gray containment borders
- 22px signature border-radius — the distinctive "Cohere card" roundness
- Dual custom typeface: CohereText (display serif) + Unica77 (body sans)
- Enterprise-grade chromatic restraint: black, white, cool grays, minimal purple-blue accent
- Deep purple/violet hero sections providing dramatic contrast
- Ghost/transparent buttons that shift to blue on hover
- Enterprise photography showing diverse real-world applications
- CohereMono for code and technical labels with uppercase transforms

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Cohere Black** (`#000000`): Primary headline text and maximum-emphasis elements.
- **Near Black** (`#2.2.2.`): Standard body link color — slightly softer than pure black.
- **Deep Dark** (`#.7.7.c`): A blue-tinted near-black for navigation and dark-section text.

### Secondary & Accent
- **Interaction Blue** (`#.863dc`): The primary interactive accent — appears on button hover, focus states, and active links. The sole chromatic action color.
- **Ring Blue** (`#.c6ee6` at 50%): Tailwind ring color for keyboard focus indicators.
- **Focus Purple** (`#9b60aa`): Input focus border color — a muted violet.

### Surface & Background
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): The primary page background and card surface.
- **Snow** (`#fafafa`): Subtle elevated surfaces and light-section backgrounds.
- **Lightest Gray** (`#f2f2f2`): Card borders and the softest containment lines.

### Neutrals & Text
- **Muted Slate** (`#93939f`): De-emphasized footer links and tertiary text — a cool-toned gray with a slight blue-violet tint.
- **Border Cool** (`#d9d9dd`): Standard section and list-item borders — a cool, slightly purple-tinted gray.
- **Border Light** (`#e5e7eb`): Lighter border variant — Tailwind's standard gray-200.

### Gradient System
- **Purple-Violet Hero Band**: Deep purple gradient sections that create dramatic contrast against the white canvas. These appear as full-width bands housing product screenshots and key messaging.
- **Dark Footer Gradient**: The page transitions through deep purple/charcoal to the black footer, creating a "dusk" effect.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Display**: `CohereText`, with fallbacks: `Space Grotesk, Inter, ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Body / UI**: `Unica77 Cohere Web`, with fallbacks: `Inter, Arial, ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Code**: `CohereMono`, with fallbacks: `Arial, ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Icons**: `CohereIconDefault` (custom icon font)

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display / Hero | CohereText | 72px (..5rem) | .00 | ..00 (tight) | -....px | Maximum impact, serif authority |
| Display Secondary | CohereText | 60px (3.75rem) | .00 | ..00 (tight) | -..2px | Large section headings |
| Section Heading | Unica77 | .8px (3rem) | .00 | ..20 (tight) | -0..8px | Feature section titles |
| Sub-heading | Unica77 | 32px (2rem) | .00 | ..20 (tight) | -0.32px | Card headings, feature names |
| Feature Title | Unica77 | 2.px (..5rem) | .00 | ..30 | normal | Smaller section titles |
| Body Large | Unica77 | .8px (...3rem) | .00 | ...0 | normal | Intro paragraphs |
| Body / Button | Unica77 | .6px (.rem) | .00 | ..50 | normal | Standard body, button text |
| Button Medium | Unica77 | ..px (0.88rem) | 500 | ..7. (relaxed) | normal | Smaller buttons, emphasized labels |
| Caption | Unica77 | ..px (0.88rem) | .00 | ...0 | normal | Metadata, descriptions |
| Uppercase Label | Unica77 / CohereMono | ..px (0.88rem) | .00 | ...0 | 0.28px | Uppercase section labels |
| Small | Unica77 | .2px (0.75rem) | .00 | ...0 | normal | Smallest text, footer links |
| Code Micro | CohereMono | 8px (0.5rem) | .00 | ...0 | 0..6px | Tiny uppercase code labels |

### Principles
- **Serif for declaration, sans for utility**: CohereText carries the brand voice at display scale — its serif terminals give headlines the authority of published research. Unica77 handles everything functional with Swiss-geometric neutrality.
- **Negative tracking at scale**: CohereText uses -..2px to -....px letter-spacing at 60–72px, creating dense, impactful text blocks.
- **Single body weight**: Nearly all Unica77 usage is weight .00. Weight 500 appears only for small button emphasis. The system relies on size and spacing, not weight contrast.
- **Uppercase code labels**: CohereMono uses uppercase with positive letter-spacing (0..6–0.28px) for technical tags and section markers.

## .. Component Stylings

### Buttons

**Ghost / Transparent**
- Background: transparent (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)`)
- Text: Cohere Black (`#000000`)
- No border visible
- Hover: text shifts to Interaction Blue (`#.863dc`), opacity 0.8
- Focus: solid 2px outline in Interaction Blue
- The primary button style — invisible until interacted with

**Dark Solid**
- Background: dark/black
- Text: Pure White
- For CTA on light surfaces
- Pill-shaped or standard radius

**Outlined**
- Border-based containment
- Used in secondary actions

### Cards & Containers
- Background: Pure White (`#ffffff`)
- Border: thin solid Lightest Gray (`.px solid #f2f2f2`) for subtle cards; Cool Border (`#d9d9dd`) for emphasized
- Radius: **22px** — the signature Cohere radius for primary cards, images, and dialog containers. Also .px, 8px, .6px, 20px for smaller elements
- Shadow: minimal — Cohere relies on background color and borders rather than shadows
- Special: `0px 0px 22px 22px` radius (bottom-only rounding) for section containers
- Dialog: 8px radius for modal/dialog boxes

### Inputs & Forms
- Text: white on dark input, black on light
- Focus border: Focus Purple (`#9b60aa`) with `.px solid`
- Focus shadow: red ring (`rgb(.79, 0, 0) 0px 0px 0px 2px`) — likely for error state indication
- Focus outline: Interaction Blue solid 2px

### Navigation
- Clean horizontal nav on white or dark background
- Logo: Cohere wordmark (custom SVG)
- Links: Dark text at .6px Unica77
- CTA: Dark solid button
- Mobile: hamburger collapse

### Image Treatment
- Enterprise photography with diverse subjects and environments
- Purple-tinted hero photography for dramatic sections
- Product UI screenshots on dark surfaces
- Images with 22px radius matching card system
- Full-bleed purple gradient sections

### Distinctive Components

**22px Card System**
- The 22px border-radius is Cohere's visual signature
- All primary cards, images, and containers use this radius
- Creates a cloud-like, organic softness that's distinctive from the typical 8–.2px

**Enterprise Trust Bar**
- Company logos displayed in a horizontal strip
- Demonstrates enterprise adoption
- Clean, monochrome logo treatment

**Purple Hero Bands**
- Full-width deep purple sections housing product showcases
- Create dramatic visual breaks in the white page flow
- Product screenshots float within the purple environment

**Uppercase Code Tags**
- CohereMono in uppercase with letter-spacing
- Used as section markers and categorization labels
- Creates a technical, structured information hierarchy

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 2px, 6px, 8px, .0px, .2px, .6px, 20px, 22px, 2.px, 28px, 32px, 36px, .0px, 56px, 60px
- Button padding varies by variant
- Card internal padding: approximately 2.–32px
- Section vertical spacing: generous (56–60px between sections)

### Grid & Container
- Max container width: up to 2560px (very wide) with responsive scaling
- Hero: centered with dramatic typography
- Feature sections: multi-column card grids
- Enterprise sections: full-width purple bands
- 26 breakpoints detected — extremely granular responsive system

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Enterprise clarity**: Each section presents one clear proposition with breathing room between.
- **Photography as hero**: Large photographic sections provide visual interest without requiring decorative design elements.
- **Card grouping**: Related content is grouped into 22px-rounded cards, creating natural information clusters.

### Border Radius Scale
- Sharp (.px): Navigation elements, small tags, pagination
- Comfortable (8px): Dialog boxes, secondary containers, small cards
- Generous (.6px): Featured containers, medium cards
- Large (20px): Large feature cards
- Signature (22px): Primary cards, hero images, main containers — THE Cohere radius
- Pill (9999px): Buttons, tags, status indicators

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, no border | Page background, text blocks |
| Bordered (Level .) | `.px solid #f2f2f2` or `#d9d9dd` | Standard cards, list separators |
| Purple Band (Level 2) | Full-width dark purple background | Hero sections, feature showcases |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Cohere is nearly shadow-free. Depth is communicated through **background color contrast** (white cards on purple bands, white surface on snow), **border containment** (cool gray borders), and the dramatic **light-to-dark section alternation**. When elements need elevation, they achieve it through being white-on-dark rather than through shadow casting.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 22px border-radius on all primary cards and containers — it's the visual signature
- Use CohereText for display headings (72px, 60px) with negative letter-spacing
- Use Unica77 for all body and UI text at weight .00
- Keep the palette black-and-white with cool gray borders
- Use Interaction Blue (#.863dc) only for hover/focus interactive states
- Use deep purple sections for dramatic visual breaks and product showcases
- Apply uppercase + letter-spacing on CohereMono for section labels
- Maintain enterprise-appropriate photography with diverse subjects

### Don't
- Don't use border-radius other than 22px on primary cards — the signature radius matters
- Don't introduce warm colors — the palette is strictly cool-toned
- Don't use heavy shadows — depth comes from color contrast and borders
- Don't use bold (700+) weight on body text — .00–500 is the range
- Don't skip the serif/sans hierarchy — CohereText for headlines, Unica77 for body
- Don't use purple as a surface color for cards — purple is reserved for full-width sections
- Don't reduce section spacing below .0px — enterprise layouts need breathing room
- Don't use decoration on buttons by default — ghost/transparent is the base state

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Small Mobile | <.25px | Compact layout, minimal spacing |
| Mobile | .25–6.0px | Single column, stacked cards |
| Large Mobile | 6.0–768px | Minor spacing adjustments |
| Tablet | 768–.02.px | 2-column grids begin |
| Desktop | .02.–...0px | Full multi-column layout |
| Large Desktop | ...0–2560px | Maximum container width |

*26 breakpoints detected — one of the most granularly responsive sites in the dataset.*

### Touch Targets
- Buttons adequately sized for touch interaction
- Navigation links with comfortable spacing
- Card surfaces as touch targets

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Full nav collapses to hamburger
- **Feature grids**: Multi-column → 2-column → single column
- **Hero text**: 72px → .8px → 32px progressive scaling
- **Purple sections**: Maintain full-width, content stacks
- **Card grids**: 3 → 2 → . column

### Image Behavior
- Photography scales proportionally within 22px-radius containers
- Product screenshots maintain aspect ratio
- Purple sections scale background proportionally

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary Text: "Cohere Black (#000000)"
- Page Background: "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Secondary Text: "Near Black (#2.2.2.)"
- Hover Accent: "Interaction Blue (#.863dc)"
- Muted Text: "Muted Slate (#93939f)"
- Card Borders: "Lightest Gray (#f2f2f2)"
- Section Borders: "Border Cool (#d9d9dd)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section on Pure White (#ffffff) with CohereText at 72px weight .00, line-height ..0, letter-spacing -....px. Cohere Black text. Subtitle in Unica77 at .8px weight .00, line-height ...."
- "Design a feature card with 22px border-radius, .px solid Lightest Gray (#f2f2f2) border on white. Title in Unica77 at 32px, letter-spacing -0.32px. Body in Unica77 at .6px, Muted Slate (#93939f)."
- "Build a ghost button: transparent background, Cohere Black text in Unica77 at .6px. On hover, text shifts to Interaction Blue (#.863dc) with 0.8 opacity. Focus: 2px solid Interaction Blue outline."
- "Create a deep purple full-width section with white text. CohereText at 60px for the heading. Product screenshot floats within using 22px border-radius."
- "Design a section label using CohereMono at ..px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.28px. Muted Slate (#93939f) text."

### Iteration Guide
.. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Always use 22px radius for primary cards — "the Cohere card roundness"
3. Specify the typeface — CohereText for headlines, Unica77 for body, CohereMono for labels
.. Interactive elements use Interaction Blue (#.863dc) on hover only
5. Keep surfaces white with cool gray borders — no warm tones
6. Purple is for full-width sections, never card backgrounds
